    <section>


		I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the <b>Otago Business School, University of Otago, New Zealand</b>. My research focuses on the connectedness of climate change and financial risk. Therefore, I invoke a mix of cross-discipline techniques, from advanced applied econometrics, credit risk analysis, spatial modelling, and financial stress testing. <p></p>

		My research interests lie in financial economics of climate change, banking, and macroeconomics.

          <p> This study investigates the association between climate vulnerability, geographic expansion and credit risk in microfinance institution’s (MFIs) loan portfolios. It is motivated by inconclusive evidence concerning the climate vulnerability-bank risk nexus and the geographic expansion-bank risk nexus. Applying system generalized method of moments (GMM) to a sample of global MFIs over the period 1999-2019, we report evidence that climate vulnerability and geographic expansion increase MFI credit risk. The risk is more pronounced for non-shareholder-owned MFIs compared to shareholder-owned MFIs. This suggests MFI expansion into climate prone regions is curtailed in the case of shareholder-owned MFIs to minimize credit risk, overshadowing the microfinance mission to provide banking services to the poorest and the most vulnerable. In addition, we report evidence that climate vulnerability moderates the consequences of geographic diversification in the microfinance industry.

          <p> This research sheds light on microfinance institution’s (MFIs) climate distress risk. We systematically investigate the effects of climate-related events on microfinance soundness/distress. The study invokes panel data regressions using an unbalanced panel sample of 3,114 MFIs from 124 countries covering the period 1999-2019. Our preliminary results suggest that MFIs are distressed by climate-induced risk. Specifically, the findings show that climate-related catastrophes have negative consequences on microfinance’s capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, and social mission. However, we find limited evidence that climatic events affect MFI managerial qualities and liquidity.

          <p>Given ambiguity concerning the effects of disclosure on firm value and markets, we examine the question of whether investors value carbon risk disclosure. Through a survey and empirical tests, we conclude that many institutional investors consider climate risk reporting to be as important as financial reporting. However, systematic variation exists in their opinions depending on firm characteristics, investor characteristics and investor beliefs about climate change. Our empirical tests show that greater institutional ownership, particularly investors from high social norm countries, is associated with a higher propensity of firms to voluntarily disclose their carbon emissions and to provide higher quality information.
