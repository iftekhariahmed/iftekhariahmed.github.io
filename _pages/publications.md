### Predicting Corporate Carbon Footprints for Climate Risk Analyses–A Machine Learning Approach (2020) ###
---<cite>Quyen Nguyen, Ivan Diaz-Rainey, & Duminda Kuruppuarachchi</cite>

This paper uses machine learning to improve the prediction of corporate emissions so that financial regulators and investors can make better decisions about climate transition risk. The need for predictions arises because only a subset of global companies report emissions. The novelty is to use machine learning rather than the conventional regression approaches and naïve models implemented by data providers. Our best-performing model is a two-step framework that applies a Meta-Elastic Net learner to combine predictions from multiple base-learners. It results in an accuracy gain based on mean absolute error of up to 30% as compared with the existing models. We find that prediction accuracy can be further improved by incorporating additional predictors (energy data) and additional firm disclosures in particular sectors (utilities and real estate) and regions (Asia and Latin America). This provides an indication of where policymakers should concentrate their efforts for greater disclosure.

### Risk to Residential Property Values from Climate Change-Related Flooding Hazards: A Mixed Methods Approach (2019) ###
---<cite>Quyen Nguyen, Ivan Diaz-Rainey, Tony Moore, Paul Thornes, Simon Cox, Leigh McKenzie, Leon Stirk-Wang</cite>

Greater South Dunedin (GSD) has been identified as one of the most vulnerable areas to Climate Change-Related Flooding Hazards (CCRFH) in New Zealand, yet little is known about the magnitude of how CCRFH will impact property values. We address this issue by proposing a novel modelling strategy that links CCRFH, and in particular Sea Level Rise (SLR), to of residential property value, at fine geographical resolution. The strategy is both empirical and forward looking modelling. The empirical analysis reveals a significant negative price effect for houses associated with flooding risks in the local market (between 5.9% and 3.1%), which existed prior to the June 2015 South Dunedin flood and was exacerbated temporarily after this event. The forward modelling projections apply a “bathtub fill” approach to elevation data in a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify the properties that will be inundated (using IPCC scenarios to 2100). Uncertainties arising from data error and long-term projection are modelled through Monte Carlo simulation. We find that, the risks of permanent inundation are currently limited and only become non-negligible in a “business-as-usual” pathway. The risks of periodic flooding, however, are strikingly large across all scenarios in the presence of extreme events. With high tides, the number of inundated properties may be as high as 39%. With extreme rainfalls, this number potentially increases to 41%. Taken together, CCFRH may affect property worth up to NZ $983 million in rateable value (37% of GSD property market). We conclude by acknowledging the limitations of our “bathtub fill” approach.

### Climate Transition Risk in U.S. Loan Portfolios: Are All Banks The Same? (2020) ###
---<cite>Quyen Nguyen, Ivan Diaz-Rainey, Duminda Kuruppuarachchi, Matthew McCarten, Eric K.M. Tan </cite>

We examine banks’ exposure to climate transition risk using loan-level data and a bottom-up methodology. We match machine learning predictions of corporate carbon footprints to syndicated loans between 2010-2018 and then aggregate these to loan portfolios of the twenty largest banks in the United States. Individual banks vary in their transition risk not only due to their exposure to the energy sectors but also due to borrowers’ carbon emission profiles from other sectors. Climate stress tests using IPCC 2019 report transition pathways reveal that the median incremental loss is minimal initially but grow towards the second half of the century. The expected loss is small relative to the loan size (0.5%) but doubles in size for the 1.5oC scenarios (1.4%-2.1%) compared to the 2oC target (0.6%-1.1%) with large tail-end risk (7.7%). Banks’ vulnerabilities are also driven by the ex-ante financial risk of their borrowers.
