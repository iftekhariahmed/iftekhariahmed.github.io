### An Energy Policy for ASEAN? Lessons from the EU Experience on Energy Integration, Security and Decarbonisation (2021) ###
---<cite>Ivan Diaz-Rainey, Daniel J. Tulloch, Iftekhar Ahmed, Matthew McCarten & Farhad Taghizadeh-Hesary</cite>

The European Union (EU) has redefined the energy sphere in Europe over the last 3 decades. Transnational policies targeting liberalization and integration, energy efficiency, renewables, carbon pricing, and energy security have led to major steps forward in terms of a more secure, integrated, and environmentally friendly energy supply. We explore, through the lenses of a paradigm shift and transition pathways, how the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping might advance its own energy trilemma through greater energy cooperation. We provide evidence that ASEAN has lagged behind in energy transition, representing considerable risks in multiple forms ‒ most notably, political and physical climate risks from failing to meet the Paris Agreement targets and the risk of stranded assets if accelerated transition is achieved. However, accelerated transition could come in many forms. By drawing on the EU experience, we argue that an energy policy for ASEAN should explicitly pursue a dual transition pathway strategy to yield the best outcome in terms of the energy trilemma. First, an "ASEAN supergrid" supported by a single energy market and by common carbon pricing would "green" urban and industrial demand. Second, "distributed smart grids" would help reap the social and economic benefits of providing electricity to the rural/remotely located population that have hitherto not had access to electricity. This is a dual transnational and local approach that contrasts with energy transition defined at national level. This interconnected approach should yield security, environmental, and economic dividends.

### Stakeholders on Board: Impact in Microfinance Sustainability and Social Outreach (2021) ###
---<cite>Mohammad Delwar Hussain, Iftekhar Ahmed, Muhammad Mohiuddin & Md. Tareq Hossain</cite>

In view of ‘social-welfare & commercial logic’ it found MFI’s services to the poor are non-linearly influenced by profitability. If MFIs pursue high profit it tends to decrease the outreach. It contributes the existing literature by supporting stewardship theory that is CEO duality is important for developing countries. It develops new dimensions of variables considering MFIs age and size as a moderating role based on stakeholder and resource dependence theory which explain the positive and significant impact on dual performances.

### Governance and Double Bottom Line Performance of Microfinance Institutions: Evidence from Bangladesh (2021) ###
---<cite>Mohammad Delwar Hussain & Iftekhar Ahmed</cite>

This study examines the impact of governance on the double bottom line performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Bangladesh. Based on a multi-theoretical approach, we analyze 80 MFIs from Bangladesh for the period between 2005-2019. We employ panel data econometrics, particularly pooled OLS, fixed effects, and two-stage system GMM to deal with potential endogeneity concerns. Our findings suggest that the presence of stakeholders on board plays a critical role in MFIs. The size of the board, independence of the board, and duality of the CEO have a major influence on the dual missions of MFIs, which supports the view of stewardship and stakeholder theories. Internal management considerations, risk perceptions and external governance also have some major impacts. Therefore, to warrant multi-stakeholder engagement, there is a need to develop a distinctive governance manual for hybrid organizations like MFIs. Our study proposes to adapt a social director on the board of directors to ensure the scope of outreach depth, given the importance of social goals in MFIs.
