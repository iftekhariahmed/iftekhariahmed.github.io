Welcome to my website. 

I am managing Investment Leaders Group (ILG) workstreams within CISL's Centre for Sustainable Finance at the University of Cambridge.

I am a climate finance expert with an extensive research and training in climate and inclusive finance. 

During my doctoral research at the University of Otago, I analysed climate-related financial risks in microfinance institutions.

I am working with [Ivan Diaz-Rainey](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/otago032953.html) and [Helen Roberts](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/helenroberts.html) on analyzing the **Climate-related Financial Risk in Microfinance Institutions** and developing a novel index to identify so-called **"too-big-to-fail"** -systemically important microfinance institutions (SIMFIs) as well as climate risks adjusted SIMFI index (CRSIMFIs).

I have assisted teaching undergraduate courses in finance including **Financial Markets and Institutions**, **Corporate Finance**, **Business Mathematics**, and have held guest lecture on **Climate Risks and Opportunities in Microfinance** at the University of Otago and **Climate Risks in Financial Institutions** at the **University of Manchester**. I also helped organize several events, such as Reading Groups, [Seminars and Webinars](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/cefgroup-webinar-do-firms-experiencing-more-wildfires-disclose-more-wildfire-information-in-their-10-ks/), [Climate Finance Symposium](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/cefgroup-past-events/call-for-papers-1st-cefgroup-climate-finance-symposium/), and [3rd GRASFI](https://www.susfinalliance2020.org/) side event on [Climate Finance in Asia and Australasia](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/online-workshop-on-climate-finance-in-asia-and-australasia/).

My research interests lie in climate finance, financial intermediation, and microfinance. I am interested in how **Climate Change** poses financial risk on **Firms, Financial Markets and Institutions** as well as the role of **Public Policy**, and **Climate-aligned Finance** for transitioning to a green, resilient and inclusive economy.
