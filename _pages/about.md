I am currently in my final year in the Finance PhD program in the University of Otago, New Zealand. 

### My Research 
My thesis title is "Climate Risks in Financial Institution", under the supervision of: Associate Professor Ivan Diaz-Rainey, Dr Duminda Kuruppuarachchi, and Dr Matthew McCartern. My research focuses on assessing the impact of climate change to financial stability. Specifically, it involves the assessment of transtional risks (i.e. carbon emissions) and phyiscal risks (i.e. sea level rise) on the largest U.S. banks. This involves a mix of cross-discipline modelling skill sets, from credit risk analysis, spatial modelling,  machine learning prediction and financial stress testing. 

### My Experience 
Prior to the graduate program, I have five years of working experience in insurance, finance & data analytics in the United States and in Vietnam. This includes 3 years in risk management role at Intel Vietnam (2010-2013), 1 year in data analytics at MD24 USA (2015-2016), 1 year in corporate finance in Pfizer Vietnam (2016-2017). I also completed my MBA degree from the University of Minnesota in June 2015. Finance is my specialty and my passion. I used to work in Carlson Investment Fund as a student analyst. This a student investment fund that manages US$ 20 million in total asset under management. I have completed the CFA Level I by the time of my graduation.  

### My Love for Data Science 
I am aspired to apply data science techniques in finance & business processes, especially in the application of machine learning/ predictive analytics.
