I am currently in my final year in the Finance PhD program at the department of Accountancy & Finance in the University of Otago. 

My research topic focuses on assessing the impact of climate change to financial stability. 

Prior to joining the University of Otago, I completed my MBA program with focus on Finance in the University of Minnesota, US. I completed my program in June 2015. While there I joined the Carlson Investment Fund, a student investment fund with total asset under management of US$ 20 million with focus in small cap stocks. I have developed strong fundamental knowledge about Finance and Investment during that time, and have completed the CFA Level I by the time of my graduation.  

I also have five year of working experience in insurance, finance & data analytics, including:  3 years in risk management role at Intel Vietnam (2010-2013), 1 year in data analytics at MD24 USA (2015-2016), 1 year in corporate finance in Pfizer Vietnam (2016-2017) and most recently in Liberty Insurance Vietnam (2017). 

In the future, I am aspired to apply data science techniques in finance & business processes, especially in the application of machine learning/ predictive analytics.
