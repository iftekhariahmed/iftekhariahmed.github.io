Welcome to my website. I lead, design and deliver research projects for the Investment Leaders Group (ILG) workstreams within **CISLâ€™s Centre for Sustainable Finance** at the **University of Cambridge**. My current projects are measuring sustainable investment impacts (ESG) and driving disclosures to inform and influence investors, standard setters and financial supervisors to accelerate financial decision-making. I aim to develop innovative ESG measures for sustainable investing to address global complex challenges.

I am a sustainable finance expert with extensive research and training in climate and inclusive finance. During my doctoral research at the University of Otago, I analysed climate-related financial risks in microfinance institutions. I have held guest lectures on climate financial risks at the **University of Otago** and the Global Development Institute, at the **University of Manchester**. I regularly present new research projects to academics, practitioners, and central banks.

My research interests lie in sustainable finance, with applications in corporate finance and banking.
