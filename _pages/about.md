Hello! My name is Iftekhar Ahmed. I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the [Climate and Energy Finance Group (CEFGroup)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/), Otago Business School, University of Otago, New Zealand. I am interested in how climate extreme poses financial risk on **Firms, Financial Markets and Institutions** as well as the role of **Public Policy**, **Adaptation Investment**, and **Climate-aligned Financing** for the **Net-zero transition**.

I am currently working with [Ivan Diaz-Rainey](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/otago032953.html) and [Helen Roberts](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/helenroberts.html) on analyzing the **Climate Risk in the Microfinance Industry** and developing a novel systemically important index to identify **Too-Big-To-Fail** microfinance Institution. I have taught undergraduate cources in finance including **Financial Markets and Institutions**, **Corporate Finance**, **Business Mathematics**, and have held guest lecture on climate change and microfinance. 

My research interests lie in financial economics of climate change, sustainable finance, financial markets and institutions.

I will be on academic job market in 2021/2022.
