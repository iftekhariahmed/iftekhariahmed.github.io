Hi! I am Iftekhar, a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the Climate and Energy Finance Group [(CEFGroup)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/), **Otago Business School, University of Otago, New Zealand**. My thesis title is `Essays on Climate Finance` under the supervision of CEFGroup's Director [Associate Professor Ivan Diaz-Rainey](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/otago032953.html) and Deputy-Director [Associate Professor Helen Roberts](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/helenroberts.html).

My research focuses on the connectedness of climate change, financial risk, and corporate sustainability. Specifically, it involves the assessment of country-level climate vulnerability and physical risk (e.g., drought, extreme temperature, flood, sea-level rise, storm, etc.) on the social enterprises, hybrid organizations, rural banks, and cooperatives, such as microfinance institutions (MFIs). Therefore, it requires invoking a mix of cross-discipline techniques, from advanced applied econometrics, credit risk analysis, developing the new climate-aligned index, spatial modeling, climate scenarios analysis and financial stress testing. In addition, I have been working as a teaching assistant for several 100, 200, and 300 level finance courses since early 2020, for both in-person and online students at the Department of Accountancy and Finance, Otago Business School. This has become an additional skill of course management and teaching during unprecedented times.

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I have several years of experience in academic research in Malaysia. This includes two research assistant roles at the Northern University of Malaysia and the Asian Research Institute for Banking and Finance, and a visiting research assistant role at the Accounting Research Institute, MARA University of Technology. During these employments, I had the chance to prove myself as a well-trained applied researcher with demonstrated skills in conducting independent research, outlining public and private funded research projects, and publishing in high-quality peer-reviewed journals. Most of my works underline the policy implications in solving real-world issues, e.g., climate change, inequality, poverty, etc. 

`Finance` is my specialty, `development` is my enthusiasm. I look into finance through the lens of development. I try to understand how financial activities and intermediates are not only relating to portfolio and profit but also can be relatable to people, the planet, and shared prosperity. My policy-oriented works have significant implications for the people at the bottom of the pyramid--the most vulnerable.

`Data science` is my emerging passion. I am aspired to learn machine learning algorithms and data analytic techniques in the decision-making process. Apart from my Ph.D. research, I have been learning to write codes and build algorithms from scratch.
