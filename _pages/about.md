Welcome to my website. I am the Lead, Systemic Resilience Analytics. I design and deliver research projects for the Investment Leaders Group (ILG) workstreams within **CISLâ€™s Centre for Sustainable Finance** at the **University of Cambridge**. My research broadly focuses on different aspects of climate and environmental (risks) analytics for resilient finance.

My current research portfolio includes:\
**(a)** assessing the complex interconnections and cascading nature of climate and environmental risks and advancing practical solutions to manage shocks in the financial ecosystem.\
**(b)** measuring sustainable investment impacts (environmental and social) and driving disclosure to inform and influence investors, standard setters and financial supervisors to accelerate the net-zero transition.\
**(c)** understanding sustainable development implications of cross-cutting social issues in climate-, nature- and transition-related finance mechanisms.

I am a sustainable finance expert with extensive research and training in climate and inclusive finance. During my doctoral research at the University of Otago, I analysed climate-related financial risks in microfinance institutions. I have held guest lectures on climate financial risks at the **University of Otago** and the Global Development Institute, at the **University of Manchester**. I regularly present new research projects to academics, practitioners, and central banks.

My research interests lie in climate and sustainable finance, with applications in corporate finance and banking.
