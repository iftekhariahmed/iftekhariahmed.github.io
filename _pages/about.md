Welcome to my website. I lead, design and deliver research projects for the Investment Leaders Group (ILG) workstreams within **CISLâ€™s Centre for Sustainable Finance** at the **University of Cambridge**. My current projects try to inform and influence how the work of institutional investors, asset managers, and financial supervisors can be aligned with inclusive, green and resilient transitions. I aim to develop innovative sustainability measurements (ESG) for sustainable investing to address global complex challenges.

I am a sustainable finance expert with extensive research and training in climate and inclusive finance. During my doctoral research at the University of Otago, I analysed climate-related financial risks in microfinance institutions. I have held guest lectures on climate financial risks at the **University of Otago** and the Global Development Institute, at the **University of Manchester**. I regularly present new research projects to academics, practitioners, and central banks.

My research interests lie in climate and sustainable finance, with applications in corporate finance, investments and banking.
