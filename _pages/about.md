Welcome to my website.

I lead research and projects for the Investment Leaders Group (ILG) workstreams within CISLâ€™s Centre for Sustainable Finance at the University of Cambridge. My intellectual curiosity drives my passion to use innovative and sophisticated economic modelling and quantitative analysis to support high-quality, evidence-based policy advice. My current projects try to inform and advance how the work of investors and asset managers as well as the role of public policy can be aligned with inclusive green transitions.

I am a climate finance expert with extensive research and training in climate and inclusive finance. During my doctoral research at the University of Otago, I analysed climate-related financial risks in microfinance institutions. I have held guest lectures on climate financial risks at the University of Otago (New Zealand) and the Global Development Institute, at the University of Manchester (UK). I regularly present new research and projects to academics, practitioners, and central banks.

My research interests lie in climate and inclusive finance, with applications in corporate finance, and financial intermediation.
