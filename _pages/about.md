I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the Climate and Energy Finance Group [(CEFGroup)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/about-us/), **University of Otago Business School, New Zealand**. My thesis title is `"Essays on Climate Finance"`, under the supervision of: 
* [Associate Professor Ivan Diaz-Rainey](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/otago032953.html), **University of Otago Business School**, New Zealand
* [Associate Professor Helen Roberts](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/helenroberts.html), **University of Otago Business School**, New Zealand

My research focuses on the connectedness of climate change and financial risk. Specifically, it involves the assessment of country-level climate vulnerability and phyiscal risk (e.g., drought, extreme temperature, flood, storm, etc.) on the microfinance institutions (MFIs). Therefore, it requires to invoke a mix of cross-discipline techniques, from advanced applied econometrics, credit risk analysis, developing new index, spatial modelling, and financial stress testing.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I have several years of working experience in academic research in Malaysia. This includes a research assistant role at the Northern University of Malaysia, the Asian Research Institute for Banking and Finance, and a visiting research assistant role at the Accounting Research Institute, MARA University of Technology. During these employments, I had chance to prove myself as a well trained applied researcher with demonstrated skills in conducting independent research, outlining public and private funded research projects, and publishing in high quality peer-reviewed journals. Most of my works underline the policy implications in solving real world issues, e.g., climate change, inequality, poverty. 

`Finance` and `Development` is my specialty. I look into finance through the lens of development. I try to understand how financial activities and intermediates are not only relating to portfolio and profit, but also can be relatable to people, planet & prosperity. I have been working as a teaching assistant for several 100, 200 and 300 level finance courses since early 2020, for both in-person and online students at the **University of Otago Business School**. This has became an aditional skill of course management and teaching during the pandemic.

`Data science` is my emerging passion. I am aspired to learn machine learning algorithm and data analytic techniques in the decision making process. Apart from my Ph.D. research, I have been learning to write codes and build algorithms from scratch.
