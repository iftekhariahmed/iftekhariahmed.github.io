Welcome to my website. I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Finance **(Climate Finance)** at the [Climate and Energy Finance Group (CEFGroup)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/), **Otago Business School, University of Otago**. I am interested in how climate extreme poses financial risk and distress on **Firms, Financial Markets and Institutions** as well as the role of **Public Policy**, and **Climate-aligned Finance and Investment** for the **Net-Zero Transition**.

I am currently working with [Ivan Diaz-Rainey](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/otago032953.html) and [Helen Roberts](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/helenroberts.html) on analyzing the **Climate Risk in the Microfinance Industry** and developing a novel systemically important index to identify **Too-Big-To-Fail** microfinance Institutions. I have assisted teaching undergraduate cources in finance including **Financial Markets and Institutions**, **Corporate Finance**, **Business Mathematics**, and have held guest lecture on **Microfinance and Climate Change**. I also helped organize several events, such as CEFGroup Reading Sessions, [CEFGroup Seminars and Webinars](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/cefgroup-webinar-do-firms-experiencing-more-wildfires-disclose-more-wildfire-information-in-their-10-ks/), [1st CEFGroup Climate Finance Symposium](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/cefgroup-past-events/call-for-papers-1st-cefgroup-climate-finance-symposium/), and [3rd GRASFI](https://www.susfinalliance2020.org/) side event on [Climate Finance in Asia and Australasia](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/online-workshop-on-climate-finance-in-asia-and-australasia/).

Prior to joining the University of Otago, I gained research experience at the **Asian Research Institute of Banking and Finance** and **Northern University of Malaysia** on several funded research projects. For example, I worked on a **Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia)** funded project on MFIâ€™s mission drifts in the ASEAN region. I also hold a M.Sc. in Finance from the Northern University of Malaysia and visited the [Accounting Research Institute](https://ari.uitm.edu.my/) at the **MARA University of Technology** during the program. Recently, I provide consultation and analytics to a joint research project on savings mobilization and **Inclusive Finance** in the ASEAN economies by the Northern University of Malaysia and the **Prince of Songkla University**.

My research interests lie in Financial Economics of Climate Change, Sustainable Finance, Financial Markets and Institutions.

I will be on job market in 2021/2022.
