Hi! I am Iftekhar, a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the Climate and Energy Finance Group [(CEFGroup)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/about-us/), **Otago Business School, University of Otago, New Zealand**. My thesis title is `Essays on Climate Finance`, under the supervision of: 
* [Associate Professor Ivan Diaz-Rainey](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/otago032953.html), **University of Otago**, New Zealand
* [Associate Professor Helen Roberts](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/helenroberts.html), **University of Otago**, New Zealand

My research focuses on the connectedness of climate change and financial risk. Specifically, it involves the assessment of country-level climate vulnerability and phyiscal risk (e.g., drought, extreme temperature, flood, storm, etc.) on the microfinance institutions (MFIs). Therefore, it requires to invoke a mix of cross-discipline techniques, from advanced applied econometrics, credit risk analysis, developing new index, spatial modelling, and financial stress testing.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I have several years of experience in academic research in Malaysia. This includes two research assistant roles at the Northern University of Malaysia and the Asian Research Institute for Banking and Finance, and a visiting research assistant role at the Accounting Research Institute, MARA University of Technology. During these employments, I had chance to prove myself as a well trained applied researcher with demonstrated skills in conducting independent research, outlining public and private funded research projects, and publishing in high quality peer-reviewed journals. Most of my works underline the policy implications in solving real world issues, e.g., climate change, inequality, poverty. 

`Finance` is my specialty, `Development` is my enthusiasm. I look into finance through the lens of development. I try to understand how financial activities and intermediates are not only relating to portfolio and profit, but also can be relatable to people, planet and prosperity. My policy oriented works have significant implications for the people at the bottom of the pyramid--the most vulnerable. In addition, I have been working as a teaching assistant for several 100, 200 and 300 level finance courses since early 2020, for both in-person and online students at the **Otago Business School**. This has became an aditional skill of course management and teaching during the unprecedented times.

`Data science` is my emerging passion. I am aspired to learn machine learning algorithm and data analytic techniques in the decision making process. Apart from my Ph.D. research, I have been learning to write codes and build algorithms from scratch.
