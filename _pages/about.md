Hello! My name is Iftekhar Ahmed. I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Finance ***(Climate Finance)*** at the [Climate and Energy Finance Group (CEFGroup)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/), **Otago Business School, University of Otago, New Zealand**. I am interested in how climate extreme poses financial risk and distress on **Firms, Financial Markets and Institutions** as well as the role of **Public Policy**, **Adaptation Investment**, and **Climate-aligned Financing** for the **Net-Zero Transition**.

I am currently working with [Ivan Diaz-Rainey](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/otago032953.html) and [Helen Roberts](https://www.otago.ac.nz/accountancyfinance/staff/helenroberts.html) on analyzing the **Climate Risk in the Microfinance Industry** and developing a novel systemically important index to identify **Too-Big-To-Fail** microfinance Institutions. I have taught undergraduate cources in finance including **Financial Markets and Institutions _(a banking course)_**, **Corporate Finance**, **Business Mathematics**, and have held guest lecture on **Climate Change and Microfinance**.

I have been also providing administrative and technical support to CEFGroup. As part of this, I helped organize several events, such as CEFGroup Research Seminars, 1st CEFGroup Climate Finance Symposium, 3rd GRASFI side event on Climate Finance in Asia and Australasia.

Prior to joining the University of Otago, I gained experience at the Asian Research Institute of Banking and Finance (Malaysia), Northern University of Malaysia (Malaysia), and MARA University of Technology (Malaysia) as a Research Assistant on several publicly and privately funded research projects. For example, I worked on a Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia) funded project on MFIâ€™s mission drifts in the ASEAN region.

My research interests lie in financial economics of climate change, sustainable finance, financial markets and institutions.

I will be on job market in 2021/2022.
