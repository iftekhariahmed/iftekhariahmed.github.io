I have been working as a teaching assistant for 100, 200 and 300 level finance courses since semester (S) 1 of 2020 at the Department of Accountancy and Finance, Otago Business School. I assist in-class students as well as online students who are unable to attend the course physically due to covid-19 pandemic. I also give guest lecture on selected climate finance topic, and provide my services to the department as exam supervisor for undergraduate and post-graduate classes.
